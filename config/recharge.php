        Find an exchange or platform that supports the TRC-20 token you want to use to top up your TRON wallet.
        Create an account on the exchange or platform and go through their verification process.
        Once your account is verified and you have deposited funds, buy the TRC-20 token you want to use to top up your TRON wallet.
        After purchasing the token, go to your TRON wallet and find the "receive" option.
        Copy the TRON wallet address shown in your wallet and use it as the receiving address when you withdraw the TRC-20 token from the exchange or platform.
        Wait for the transaction to be processed and once the TRC-20 tokens are in your TRON wallet, your wallet balance will be topped up with the amount of TRC-20 tokens you deposited.
